Autocompletion is a plugin to support editing of arbitrary text files
through offering autocompletion while typing. The plugin is highly inspired by
http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=73 but in contrast
much much faster.

VARIABLES

Activate fast word completion for the defined filetypes, a comma separated
string or *.

let g:fastwordcompleter_filetypes = 'filetype,...'

Normally the vim complete option is set to show no menu if only one item is
avaiable for completion. Autocompletion sets completeopt to menuone to display
also single items. If you don't like this set the following variable.

let g:loaded_autocompletion = 1

COMMANDS

Start and stop autocompletion or use the menu Plugin/Autocompletion:

:AutocompletionStart
:AutocompletionStop
